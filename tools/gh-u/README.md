gh-u is an extension for the GitHub CLI defining a few utility functions.
These are specific to my needs and are probably not useful to anyone else.

Install by running:

```bash
make install
```

Install aliases for common commands after installation with:

```bash
gh u alias install
# or
gh u alias install --force
```
